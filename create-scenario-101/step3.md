To help create the index.json and scenario structure, Katacoda has developed a command line interactive (CLI) to help create and manage scenarios.

## Install CLI

Install the CLI with the command `curl -ssL https://cli.katacoda.com | sh`{{execute}}.

After the install has finished, the command can be run via `katacoda`{{execute}}.

For example, to create a new scenario you would run the command `katacoda create scenario`{{execute}}.
